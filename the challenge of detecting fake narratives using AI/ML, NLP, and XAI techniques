To address the challenge of detecting fake narratives using AI/ML, NLP, and XAI techniques, I propose an initial approach
focusing on text-based analysis. Here's a structured plan:
Objective
Develop an NLP-based model to detect fake narratives by analyzing text data from labeled sources.

Methodology

1. Data Collection
   - Gather text data from known fake and real sources.
   - Ensure dataset diversity to cover various types of fake content (e.g., videos, articles).

2. Preprocessing
   - Tokenize texts into manageable units.
   - Remove stop words and punctuation for cleaner analysis.
   - Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF or BERT embeddings.

3. Feature Extraction
   - Utilize BERT embeddings for robust representation of text content.
   - This step enhances the model's ability to capture nuanced meanings in text.

4. Model Training
   - Use machine learning models like SVM or Random Forest on the extracted features.
   - Split data into training and testing sets (e.g., 70% train, 30% test).

5. Evaluation
   - Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy and precision.
   - Ensure robustness through cross-validation.

6. Explainability
   - Apply SHAP values to interpret feature importance in predictions.
   - Provide insights into which words or phrases contribute most to detecting fake content.

 Visual and Technical Components

- Flowchart: Illustrates the NLP pipeline from data collection to model deployment.
- Dataset Structure: Example table showing labeled text data.
- Feature Extraction Table: Outlines methods used (e.g., BERT vs TF-IDF).

This approach ensures a clear, manageable plan for initial implementation in the hackathon setting. It balances simplicity with
effectiveness, leveraging advanced techniques like BERT and SHAP for robust detection and explainability.
